Explanation:

The function isPalindrome takes a single argument s, which is the input string we want to check for palindromes.

Two pointers, i and j, are initialized to the start and end of the string, respectively.

The while loop runs until the two pointers meet or cross each other. This loop is the core of the palindrome checking algorithm.

Inside the loop, the characters at positions i and j are obtained using s.charAt(i) and s.charAt(j).

The code checks if the character at position i is not a letter or digit using Character.isLetterOrDigit(start). If it's not, the i pointer is moved one step to the right, effectively skipping this character in the palindrome check.

Similarly, the code checks if the character at position j is not a letter or digit. If it's not, the j pointer is moved one step to the left, effectively skipping this character in the palindrome check.

If both characters at positions i and j are letters or digits, the code compares them, ignoring case (converting them to lowercase using Character.toLowerCase()).

If the characters are not equal, the function immediately returns false, indicating that the string is not a palindrome.

If the characters are equal, the loop continues to the next iteration by moving the i pointer one step to the right and the j pointer one step to the left.

If the loop completes without finding any mismatched characters, it means the string is a palindrome, and the function returns true.
