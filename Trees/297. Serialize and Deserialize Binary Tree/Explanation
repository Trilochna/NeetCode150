 * Definition for a binary tree node.

```
This section of code includes a comment that defines a TreeNode class representing nodes of a binary tree. Each node has an integer value (`val`) and references to its left and right children nodes.

```java
public class Codec {
    private int i; // global variable used for deserialize
```
The `Codec` class is defined, which will provide methods to serialize and deserialize binary trees. It includes a private integer variable `i`, which will be used as a pointer during deserialization.

```java
public String serialize(TreeNode root) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    serializeDFS(root, result);
    return String.join(",", result);       
}
```
The `serialize` method takes a `TreeNode` as input and returns its serialized representation as a comma-separated string. It creates an empty list called `result` to store the serialized values and then calls the `serializeDFS` helper method to perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal of the binary tree and populate the `result` list with node values.

```java
public void serializeDFS(TreeNode root, List<String> result){
    if(root == null){
        result.add("N");
        return;
    }
    result.add(String.valueOf(root.val));
    serializeDFS(root.left, result);
    serializeDFS(root.right, result);
}
```
The `serializeDFS` helper method performs a DFS traversal of the binary tree. If the current node is `null`, it adds "N" (indicating a null node) to the `result` list. Otherwise, it converts the integer value of the current node to a string and adds it to the `result` list. It then recursively calls itself for the left and right children of the current node.

```java
public TreeNode deserialize(String data) {
    String[] result = data.split(",");
    return deserializeDFS(result);        
}
```
The `deserialize` method takes a serialized string as input and returns the corresponding binary tree. It splits the input string by commas to obtain an array of node values and then calls the `deserializeDFS` helper method to construct the binary tree.

```java
public TreeNode deserializeDFS(String[] result){
    String rootNode = result[this.i];
    if(rootNode.equals("N")){
        this.i++;
        return null;
    }
    var node = new TreeNode(Integer.parseInt(rootNode));
    this.i++;
    node.left = deserializeDFS(result);
    node.right = deserializeDFS(result);
    return node;
}
```
The `deserializeDFS` helper method constructs a binary tree using a recursive approach. It uses the `i` pointer to access the values from the `result` array. If the current node value is "N," indicating a null node, it increments the pointer and returns `null`. Otherwise, it creates a new `TreeNode` with the integer value obtained from the array. It then increments the pointer and recursively calls itself to construct the left and right subtrees for the current node.

```java
// Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
// Codec ser = new Codec();
// Codec deser = new Codec();
// TreeNode ans = deser.deserialize(ser.serialize(root));
```
This comment provides an example of how to use the `Codec` class. It demonstrates how to create an instance of the `Codec` class (`ser` and `deser`) and use it to serialize and deserialize a binary tree.

In summary, this Java code defines a `Codec` class that provides methods to serialize and deserialize binary trees using Depth-First Search (DFS). The `serialize` method converts a binary tree to a comma-separated string, and the `deserialize` method constructs a binary tree from a serialized string. The helper methods `serializeDFS` and `deserializeDFS` handle the recursive traversal and construction of the binary tree.
