Input:
```plaintext
root = [3,4,5,1,2]
subRoot = [4,1,2]
```

To better visualize the trees, let's represent them in a structured format:

Root Tree:
```
    3
   / \
  4   5
 / \
1   2
```

SubRoot Tree:
```
  4
 / \
1   2
```

Now, we'll walk through the process of checking if the `subRoot` tree is a subtree of the `root` tree using the given code.

1. Call `isSubtree(root, subRoot)`:
    - `root` is `[3,4,5,1,2]`
    - `subRoot` is `[4,1,2]`

2. Inside `isSubtree`:
    - `subRoot` is not `null`, and it's not the same as `root`, so we proceed.
    - `root` is not `null`.

3. Recurse into `isSubtree(root.left, subRoot)`:
    - `root.left` is `[4,1,2]`
    - `subRoot` is `[4,1,2]`

4. Inside `isSubtree`:
    - `subRoot` is not `null`, and it's the same as `root.left`, so we return `true`.

The result is `true`, indicating that the `subRoot` tree is indeed a subtree of the `root` tree.

So, the output is:
```plaintext
Output: true
```

The given code checks the structure and values of nodes in the trees through recursion, and in this case, it correctly identifies that the `subRoot` tree is a subtree of the `root` tree.
