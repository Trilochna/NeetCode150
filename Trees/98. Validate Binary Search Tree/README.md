# [98. Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left 
subtree
 of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

 Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1

#### Explanation : 

T.C = O(n^2)
