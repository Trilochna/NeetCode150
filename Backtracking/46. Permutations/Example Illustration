Certainly! Let's walk through how the provided input `[1,2,3]` would be processed and generate the output `[[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]` using the given code:

1. Initial state:
   - `nums = [1,2,3]`
   - `ans` is an empty list, `ans = []`

2. The `permute` method is called with `nums` as an argument.
   - `ans` is initialized as an empty list, `ans = []`
   - The `function` method is called with `ans`, `nums`, and `0` as arguments.

3. In the `function` method:
   - `start` is initially `0`, which is less than the length of `nums`, so we continue.

4. We enter the `for` loop in the `function` method, which iterates from `start` to the end of the array (`i` starts at `0`).
   - Inside the loop, we swap `nums[0]` (1) with `nums[0]` (1). This is effectively a no-op, and we proceed with `start + 1`.

5. We call the `function` method again recursively with an incremented `start`.
   - `start` is now `1`, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.

6. We swap `nums[1]` (2) with `nums[1]` (2), which is also a no-op.
   - `start` is incremented to `2`, and we call the `function` method again.

7. We swap `nums[2]` (3) with `nums[2]` (3), another no-op.
   - `start` is now `3`, and we call the `function` method again.

8. Now, `start` is equal to the length of `nums` (which is `3`), so we enter the condition `if (start == arr.length)`:
   - We create a new list `list` and add the elements of `nums` to it. `list = [1, 2, 3]`
   - We add `list` to `ans`. `ans = [[1, 2, 3]]`

9. We return from the current invocation of the `function` method to the previous level of recursion (backtracking).
   - We swap `nums[2]` and `nums[2]` back to their original positions.
   - This brings us back to the previous state where `start` was `2`.

10. In the loop at `start` equal to `2`, we swap `nums[1]` (2) with `nums[2]` (3), resulting in `nums = [1, 3, 2]`.
    - We call the `function` method again with an incremented `start` of `3`.

11. `start` is now equal to the length of `nums` (which is `3`), so we enter the condition `if (start == arr.length)`:
    - We create a new list `list` and add the elements of `nums` to it. `list = [1, 3, 2]`
    - We add `list` to `ans`. `ans = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2]]`

12. We return from the current invocation of the `function` method to the previous level of recursion (backtracking).
    - We swap `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` back to their original positions, bringing us back to the state where `start` was `2`.

13. We continue the loop by swapping `nums[2]` (2) with `nums[2]` (3), resulting in `nums = [1, 2, 3]`.

14. We return from the current invocation of the `function` method to the previous level of recursion, which brings us back to the state where `start` was `1`.

15. In the loop at `start` equal to `1`, we swap `nums[0]` (1) with `nums[1]` (2), resulting in `nums = [2, 1, 3]`.
    - We call the `function` method again with an incremented `start` of `2`.

16. `start` is now equal to the length of `nums` (which is `3`), so we enter the condition `if (start == arr.length)`:
    - We create a new list `list` and add the elements of `nums` to it. `list = [2, 1, 3]`
    - We add `list` to `ans`. `ans = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3]]`

17. We return from the current invocation of the `function` method to the previous level of recursion (backtracking).
    - We swap `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` back to their original positions, bringing us back to the state where `start` was `1`.

18. We continue the loop by swapping `nums[1]` (1) with `nums[1]` (2), resulting in `nums = [1, 2, 3]`.

19. We return from the current invocation of the `function` method to the previous level of recursion, which brings us back to the state where `start` was `0`.

20. In the loop at `start` equal to `0`, we swap `nums[0]` (1) with `nums[0]` (1), effectively a no-op, and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

21. We swap `nums[0]` (1) with `nums[1]` (2), resulting in `nums = [2, 1, 3]`.
    - We call the `function` method again with an incremented `start` of `1`.

22. We swap `nums[1]` (1) with `nums[1]` (2), another no-op.
    - `start` is now `2`, and we call the `function` method again.

23. `start` is now equal to the length of `nums` (which is `3`), so we enter the condition `if (start == arr.length)`:
    - We create a new list `list` and add the elements of `nums` to it. `list = [2, 1, 3]`
    - We add `list` to `ans`. `ans = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1]]`

24. We return from the current invocation of the `function` method to the previous level of recursion (backtracking).
    - We swap `nums[1]` and `nums[1]` back to their original positions, bringing us back to the state where `start
