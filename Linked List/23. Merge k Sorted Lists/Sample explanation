**Sample Input:**
Input: `lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]`

1. **Initialization:**
   - `size` = 3 (number of lists)
   - `interval` = 1

2. **1st Iteration (`interval = 1`):**
   - Merging pairs of lists: `[1,4,5]` and `[1,3,4]`
   - Result after merging: `[1,1,3,4,4,5]`
   - Remaining lists: `[[1,1,3,4,4,5],[2,6]]`

3. **Doubling Interval:**
   - `interval` = 2

4. **2nd Iteration (`interval = 2`):**
   - Merging pairs of lists: `[1,1,3,4,4,5]` and `[2,6]`
   - Result after merging: `[1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]`
   - Remaining lists: `[[1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]]`

5. **Doubling Interval:**
   - Since `interval` (2) is now greater than or equal to `size` (1), the while loop terminates.

6. **Final Output:**
   - Return `[1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]` as the merged result.

In summary, the code starts by merging adjacent pairs of lists with `interval = 1`. After the first iteration, the merged list replaces the original lists, and the interval is doubled. The process continues until the interval becomes greater than or equal to the size of the lists. Eventually, all the lists are merged into a single sorted list `[1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]`, as demonstrated by the output.
